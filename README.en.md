Fast-Https is a high-performance, multi-tasking web server product developed in Go language. It supports popular protocols and standards such as HTTP 1.1, HTTP 2.0, HTTPS, and RPC. It also offers reverse proxy functionality. Notably, the web server includes a built-in feature for generating self-signed SSL certificates, which greatly facilitates addressing the issue of server access based on the HTTPS protocol in testing environments.

Currently, we provide installation packages for both Windows and Linux platforms, with products for other platforms being gradually released.

#### Software Architecture
Fast-Https is designed and developed in a modular manner, where the core server module supports horizontal expansion and the addition of new functionalities through plugins. This enhances the capabilities of the server.
